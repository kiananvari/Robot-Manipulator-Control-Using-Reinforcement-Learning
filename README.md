# Robot-Manipulator-Control-Using-Reinforcement-Learning-
This repository contains the implementation of a robot manipulator control system using reinforcement learning techniques. The goal of this project is to train a robot to navigate an environment, detect different targets, and avoid obstacles using reinforcement learning algorithms such as PPO and curriculum learning.
